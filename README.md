# Agricultural Equipment Rental Platform

## Problem Statement

Empowering rural India's agricultural community, our comprehensive platform revolutionizes the traditional equipment rental process. With centralized access to a diverse range of machinery and seamless booking, coupled with the facilitation of resource sharing and elevate productivity in farming practices.

## Introduction

Farmers face difficulties in finding agricultural machinery for rent. Delayed access to equipment, especially during critical periods like the rainy season, affects farm productivity. For instance, inadequate access to tractors during the rainy season can lead to missed opportunities for soil preparation, affecting crop yield.

## Objectives

1. Provide a user-friendly platform for farmers to easily access rental agricultural equipment.
2. Enable machine owners to monetize their idle equipment by connecting them with potential customers.
3. Empower large-scale farmers to share their machinery during idle periods, fostering a collaborative farming community.
4. Improve farm productivity and crop yield by ensuring timely access to essential equipment.

## Proposed System

Development of an online platform for booking agricultural equipment rentals, including:

1. Integration of farmer and machine owner profiles for seamless transactions.
2. Implementation of scheduling features to manage equipment availability.
